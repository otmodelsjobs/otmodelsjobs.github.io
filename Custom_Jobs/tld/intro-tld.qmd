# Trip Length Distribution

::::: nav-pills
:::: panel-tabset
### Purpose

This job can create trip length distribution for a normal matrix or for a select link matrix or any matrix. One of these matrices is then combined with a skim matrix of choice

### Inputs

Following are the inputs to this job. You will also need a encrypted file tld.rc in your job folder. 

The following parameters are used to select the matrices and create a table.

- The parameter `mode_matrix_number`: is the matrix number of the trip matrix.
- The parameter `skim_matrix_number`: is the matrix number of the skim matrix.
- The parameters used for the chart are also used for the table.

The following parameters are used for plotting a chart. 

- The parameter `x_axis_max`: is the maximum distance you want to show on the x-axis. 
- The parameter `x_axis_min`: is the minimum distance you want to show on the x-axis.
- The parameter `x_axis_interval`: is the interval on the x-axis.

``` ruby
$mode_matrix_number = [1,11,10,1] # trip matrix
$skim_matrix_number = [1,11,10,1,13,1]  # skim matrix

$x_axis_max = 11 # max value on x-axis
$x_axis_min = 0 # min value on x-axis
$x_axis_interval =  1 # interval on x-axis
```

### Outputs

Following are the outputs to this job:

-    A tabular format that you can copy paste into excel.

-    A chart that you can save as an image.

This script creates a trip length distribution chart 
based on trip and distance matrices. It uses the OtChart library
to visualize the distribution of trips by distance.
